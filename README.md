# Frontend Mentor - Expenses chart component

![Design preview for the Expenses chart component coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out this front-end coding challenge.

This is my solution to the [Expenses chart component challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/expenses-chart-component-e7yJBUdjwt). 

[Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

**To do this challenge, you need a decent understanding of HTML, CSS and JavaScript.**

## The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this bar chart component and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

We provide the data for the chart in a local `data.json` file. So you can use that to dynamically add the bars if you choose.

Your users should be able to:

- View the bar chart and hover over the individual bars to see the correct amounts for each day
- See the current day's bar highlighted in a different colour to the other bars
- View the optimal layout for the content depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- **Bonus**: See dynamically generated bars based on the data provided in the local JSON file

## Building your project

Feel free to use any workflow that you feel comfortable with. Below is a suggested process, but do not feel like you need to follow these steps:

1. Initialize your project as a public repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/). Creating a repo will make it easier to share your code with the community if you need help. If you're not sure how to do this, [have a read-through of this Try Git resource](https://try.github.io/).
2. Configure your repository to publish your code to a web address. This will also be useful if you need some help during a challenge as you can share the URL for your project with your repo URL. There are a number of ways to do this, and we provide some recommendations below.
3. Look through the designs to start planning out how you'll tackle the project. This step is crucial to help you think ahead for CSS classes to create reusable styles.
4. Before adding any styles, structure your content with HTML. Writing your HTML first can help focus your attention on creating well-structured content.
5. Write out the base styles for your project, including general content styles, such as `font-family` and `font-size`.
6. Start adding styles to the top of the page and work down. Only move on to the next section once you're happy you've completed the area you're working on.
